<p>This project is a Seoul flagship store of French fashion brand ‘Maison Margiela’. Maison Margiela’s brand identity is anonymous and deconstructive, with a focus on creating clothes for everyone on the street, not just a single muse or celebrity. Maison Margiela expresses the essence of clothes through avant-garde and deconstructive characteristics without using brand tags or logos. ‘Maison Anonymous’ is a space that shows the essence of the clothes that Margiela wanted to show, and is a store where anyone can comfortably and freely experience the brand identity. Located in Dosan Park of the center of high fashion brands in Seoul, this store is a fashion house that is easily accessible to anyone on the street. The simple square mass design and irregularly placed windows are reminiscent of a mosaic and express anonymity.</p>
